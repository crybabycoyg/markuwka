                <H1>William Shakespeare</H1>
          
                <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
                
                <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as
                    the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national
                    poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets,
                    two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into
                    every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p>
                
                <p>Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with
                    whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful
                    career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known
                    as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.
                    Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as
                    his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by
                    others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of
                    the period.</p>
                
                <p>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and
                    histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly
                    tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the
                    English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with
                    other playwrights.</p>
                
                <p>Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in
                    1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text
                    known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of
                    his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a
                    now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new
                    movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through
                    various cultural and political contexts around the world.</p>
