                    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house
                    cat
                    to
                    distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can
                    also be
                    farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are
                    valued
                    by
                    humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
                    various
                    cat
                    registries. The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body,
                    quick
                    reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its
                    night
                    vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing,
                    purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although
                    the
                    cat
                    is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. A predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at
                    dawn
                    and dusk.

                <p>It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and
                    other small mammals. It also secretes and
                    perceives pheromones. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter
                    sizes
                    often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered
                    pedigreed
                    cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
                    neutering,
                    but
                    their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats
                    worldwide,
                    contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p>

                <p>It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
                    around
                    3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication
                    occurred in
                    Western Asia around 7500 BC. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million
                    stray
                    cats in the world. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United
                    States,
                    with
                    95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United
                    Kingdom,
                    26%
                    of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.</p>
